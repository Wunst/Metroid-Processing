# Plantoid - A Tiny Metroid Clone
Metroid clone made in Java/Processing 3.5.4 for a school project in 2022.

## Controls
- Left/right: Move
- Y: Shoot gun, Advance dialog
- X: Shoot missile
- Down: Curl up/Uncurl (requires Morphball)
- Y (when curled up): Place bomb (requires Morphball+Bombs)
- Up: Nothing. Useless keybind

## Known Bugs
Gravity acts funny sometimes

## Story
Human colony has been taken over by plant zombies. Destroy the Mother Plant and
prevent the infestation from spreading. (PS: The plants keep the planet
together so expect some unpleasant consequences when you have killed the boss)

## Note
Some enemies can only be damaged using missiles. Missiles drop from enemies
with a 10% chance but I have also given the player 10 in the beginning to
accelerate progress (especially for playtesting and grading).
